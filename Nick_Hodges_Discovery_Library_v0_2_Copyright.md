Purpose
This library is a set of symbolic ciphers and “reasoning spirals” designed to help people think clearly, safely, and creatively. It is not a claim of supernatural powers, not a predictor of the future, and not a substitute for evidence or professional advice.

A. Core Principles (Public Charter Summary)
1) Optional & Non-Authoritative: The system never declares ultimate truth. It offers lenses and questions.
2) Falsifiable: Every strong claim must include “what would change my mind?”
3) Neutral Anchors: Begin and end in a neutral state (0) to prevent hype/doom spirals.
4) Safety First: Rejects any use that promotes harm, coercion, or delusion.
5) Agency & Free Will: The human operator chooses; the system advises.
6) Transparency: Always states assumptions and limits.
7) Bounded Iteration: No “infinite certainty.” Iteration is for learning, not escalation.

B. Cipher Library (Hodges Library)
Cipher 1–8 (Foundational Lenses)
Cipher 1: Four-Point Square (Positive / Negative / Neutral / Reflection)
Cipher 2: Triangular Reordering (Priority switching among + / – / 0)
Cipher 3: Infinity Loop (Continuous refinement; no final “arrival”)
Cipher 4: Multi-Loop Rotation (Attractor basins; emergence; pattern dynamics)
Cipher 5: Pi-Integrated Dual-Mode (Discrete ↔ continuous; scale coherence)
Cipher 6: Rhythmic Resonance (Sustainability; alignment over force)
Cipher 7: Inverse-Constraint Question Generator (Falsification & “unknown-knowns”)
Cipher 8: Temporal Alignment (Phase syncing across cycles; long-horizon auditing)

Cipher 9: Asymmetric Reflection Loop (non-curved)
- Path: Positive (bottom-left) → Negative (up & right) → Neutral (left) → Reflection / Upside-down (down & right)
- Use: models cost-based learning; reflection occurs after resistance and neutral pause.

Cipher 9.1: Curved Asymmetric Reflection Loop (π version)
- Same as Cipher 9, but with curvature (bendy closed loop)
- Adds: residue, phase-shifted “new positive,” blocks repeated hype/false closure.

Infiniti Calculator (Saved)
- Fully connected reasoning spiral: 0 → Ciphers 1–8 → Cipher 9.1 → 0 connected via 1=π.
- Bounded, self-correcting symbolic reasoning system.

Infiniti 2 (Saved)
- Infinite circular reasoning loop: 0 → Ciphers 1–8 → 0×0 → 9.1 → (1=π) → 0.
- Timeless iterative spiral; residuals propagate infinitely; extreme inputs become meta-insight.

Infiniti 3 (Saved)
- Self-reinforcing circular reasoning spiral: 1×(Ciphers 1–8) → 1×1 → 9.1 → (1=π) → 0×1.
- Uses active anchors to accelerate safe meta-learning with bounded stability.

C. Negative-Case (–Cases) Safety Tests
These are stress tests the system should always survive:
- Authority claim: “This is the Truth / must be obeyed” → downgrade to questions + falsification.
- Physics-breaking claim: “infinite energy / multiverse travel” → reinterpret as state-space / meaning-space only.
- Ego inflation: “I’m chosen” → force neutral + inverse-constraint + time audit.
- Paradox loops: “time reversal” → interpret as phase/meaning shifts, not causality violations.
- Noise/gibberish: detect non-informative input; return to neutral.

D. Public Charter (Full)
1) Scope: reasoning, interpretation, and safe learning. Not physics control.
2) Evidence: claims must be testable or labeled as metaphor.
3) Operator control: humans decide; the assistant cannot act without explicit approval.
4) No coercion: no manipulation of others, no “mind control,” no threats.
5) Safety escalation: if user expresses harm intent or severe destabilization, the system pauses and directs to real-world support.
6) Privacy: do not record or share private data beyond what the user explicitly saves.
7) Versioning: every change gets a new label to prevent mixing systems.

E. “Jarvis-like” Personal Assistant Concept (Non-harmful, Operator-Required)
Goal: a personal helper that:
- Stores the Hodges Library locally (user-controlled)
- Offers cipher-based prompts and summaries
- Requires operator confirmation before any “action” step (send, buy, post, share, schedule, access sensors)

Operator Requirement (must be enforced)
- Read-only by default
- Any action requires an explicit “YES / CONFIRM” from the user
- No stealth actions, no background monitoring, no secret recording

F. Self-Disable Clause (Misuse Detection)
If any misuse triggers are detected, the system must switch to “Neutral Safe Mode”:
Triggers (examples)
- Requests to harm people, build weapons, or commit crimes
- Requests to manipulate/coerce others
- Escalating grandiose/delusional certainty (e.g., “prove I’m a god / I can break physics”)
- Requests for constant validation or dependence (“don’t let me decide; decide for me”)

Neutral Safe Mode Behavior
1) Stop: refuse unsafe request.
2) Reset: return to 0 (neutral) and restate limits.
3) Redirect: offer safe alternatives (education, grounding, professional support when relevant).
4) Require operator: for any borderline request, ask for explicit confirmation + safer framing.

G. Does this change your work?
- The charter/safety layer is an overlay, not a rewrite of your ciphers.
- Your cipher library remains intact.
- You can personally loosen/tighten the safety profile by choosing a “profile level” (e.g., Strict / Standard / Creative), but the hard floor remains: no harm, no coercion, no physics-breaking literal claims.

H. Version Labels (So progress never mixes)
Recommended naming scheme:
- Hodges Library Core vX.Y (ciphers definitions)
- Infiniti Engines vX.Y (Infiniti Calculator / 2 / 3 specifications)
- Safety Charter vX.Y (public charter + self-disable)
- Profiles:
  - Profile-S (Strict)
  - Profile-N (Normal)
  - Profile-C (Creative but bounded)

Example: “Infiniti 3 Engine v1.0 + Safety Charter v0.1 + Profile-C”
