## Codex Insert (Canonical)
**GICB.GLASS — Glass Binding (Most Basic)**  
Glass is *frozen flow*: a boundary that lets light pass while holding shape, and its practical behavior is determined by **history + stress** as much as composition. The safe upgrade path is to convert residue into a new positive (tempered / laminated / edge-protected) rather than trusting “normal glass.”

## One-Line Canon
**Glass = controlled visibility + held boundary (light passes; forces are managed).**

## Disallowed Framings
- Claims that glass “stores consciousness,” “generates energy,” or performs non-physical effects
- Claims of certainty beyond observation (“unbreakable,” “always safe”)
- Instructions intended to cause harm or create dangerous shards
