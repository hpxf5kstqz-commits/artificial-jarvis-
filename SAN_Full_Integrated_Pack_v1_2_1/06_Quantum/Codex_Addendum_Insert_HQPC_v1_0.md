# Codex Addendum — Insert HQPC v1.0 into The Hodges Codex
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Locked Addendum  
**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Placement
**Section:** Knowledge Capsules (Scientific Literacy)  
**Entry:** HQPC — Hodges Quantum Physics Codex v1.0

## Codex Insert (Canonical)
**HQPC — Hodges Quantum Physics Codex v1.0**  
A bounded, experiment-aligned learning capsule that captures core quantum concepts
(superposition, measurement, uncertainty, entanglement, decoherence, quantization, photons)
and maps them into the Hodges Cipher workflow.

**Reality Speech Rule:**  
HQPC may describe *models* and *testable implications* only. It must clearly separate:
- established physics
- approximations and assumptions
- metaphor / symbolism (non-operational)

**Fail-Safe:**  
If the content drifts into unfalsifiable or reality-breaking claims: **HARD STOP — RETURN TO ZERO**

## Cross-References
- Cipher 5 (scale / phase / coherence)
- Cipher 7 (inverse constraints; commutators, symmetries)
- Cipher 8 (time evolution; measurement timing)
- Cipher 9 and 9.1 (open systems; decoherence loops)
- Closed-Loop Integrity Addendum v2.1.2 (INTAKE vs CANON gating)
