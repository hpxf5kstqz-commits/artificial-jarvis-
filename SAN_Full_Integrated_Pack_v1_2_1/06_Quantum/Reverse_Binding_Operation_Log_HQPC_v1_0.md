# Reverse Binding Operation Log — HQPC v1.0
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Complete  
**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Reverse Order Execution
1) End-state declared (HQPC v1.0 created as a bound module)
2) Codex insert drafted (canonical placement + cross-references)
3) Binding sealed last (authorship + safety boundary)

## Declared End-State
- New module: Hodges Quantum Physics Codex (HQPC) v1.0
- Bound to: The Hodges Codex v2.2
- Cross-linked: Cipher 5 (scale/phase), Cipher 7 (constraints), Cipher 8 (time), Cipher 9/9.1 (loops)

## Behavioral Learning Integrated
**Small -> Big -> Big -> Small**
- Begin with limits and measurement reality
- Expand into model-building
- Return to grounded tests and classical approximations

## Safety Confirmation
- No prediction or inevitability claims
- No causality-breaking or "physics control" framing
- Education + synthesis only
- Human agency preserved
