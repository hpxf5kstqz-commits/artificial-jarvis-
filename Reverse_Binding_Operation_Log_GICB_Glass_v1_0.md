# Reverse Binding Operation Log — GICB.GLASS
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Complete  
**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Reverse Order Execution
1) Declared end-state (the bound “basic truth” to preserve)
2) Infiniti Calculator run (Ciphers 1–8 → 9.1)
3) Return-to-zero seal (one-line canon)
4) Packaging (PDF + DOCX + logs)

## Declared End-State
- New bound module: **Hodges Infiniti Calculator Binding (GICB) — GLASS v1.0**
- Canon preserved as: **Glass = controlled visibility + held boundary**
- Residue rule preserved as: **stress/history are part of the material**

## Behavioral Learning Integrated
**See-through ≠ safe**
- Transparency can hide stress until release.
- Edge protection and pacing (cooling/handling) reduce surprise failure.
- “Strength” is conditional; conditions must be named.

## Safety Confirmation
- Educational + symbolic framing only
- No engineering specifications or guarantees
- No unsafe “physics-breaking” claims
- Human judgment required for real-world decisions
