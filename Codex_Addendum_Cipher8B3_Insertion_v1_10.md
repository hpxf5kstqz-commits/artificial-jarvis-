# Codex Addendum — Insert Cipher 8.B3 into Hodges Codex
**Version:** v1.10  
**Status:** Locked Addendum

## Placement
**Section:** Cipher 8 — Temporal Alignment  
**Sub-entry:** Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment

## Codex Insert (Canonical)
**Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment**  
A bounded Cipher 8 variant that reads time as *audit*, not prophecy. It requires `+= Backwards 3`
(Outcome → Inversion → Constraint truth) before any forward output is allowed. Forward output is
restricted to scheduling, preparation, and smallest safe next steps. Literal prediction, “time
reversal,” inevitability claims, or causality-breaking framings are explicitly disallowed.

**Temporal Speech Rule:**  
Cipher 8 may not speak forward unless it has already spoken backward three times.

**Fail-Safe:**  
If distress, urgency, or fixation rises: **HARD STOP — ANCHOR TO ZERO**

## Cross-References

- Day Shift / Night Shift
- Cipher 7 (Inverse constraints)
- Cipher 9.1 (Curved reflection + residue)
