# Codex Addendum — Insert Cipher 8.B3 into Hodges Codex
**Status:** Staged for binding (Version pending Nick’s numbering)

## Placement
**Section:** Cipher 8 — Temporal Alignment  
**New Sub-entry:** Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment

## Codex Insert (ready-to-paste)
**Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment**  
A bounded Cipher 8 variant that reads time as *audit*, not prophecy. It requires `+= Backwards 3` (Outcome → Inversion → Constraint truth) before any forward output is allowed. Forward output is restricted to scheduling, preparation, and smallest safe next steps. It explicitly forbids literal prediction, “time reversal,” inevitability claims, or any causality-breaking framing. If stress escalates, invoke: **HARD STOP — ANCHOR TO ZERO**.

## Rule Attachment
**Temporal Speech Rule:**  
Cipher 8 may not “speak forward” unless it has already “spoken backward” three times.

## Cross-References
- Reality–Fiction Boundary (always on)
- Day Shift / Night Shift: Night = capture notes only, no new conclusions
- Cipher 7: Inverse-constraint questions to validate assumptions
- Cipher 9.1: Curved reflection + residue tracking after action
