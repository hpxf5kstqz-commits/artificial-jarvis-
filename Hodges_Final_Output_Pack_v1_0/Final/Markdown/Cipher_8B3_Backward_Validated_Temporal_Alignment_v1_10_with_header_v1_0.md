# Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment
**Version:** v1.10  
**Status:** Locked and Canonical

## Canonical Definition
Cipher 8.B3 is a Cipher 8 variant that permits forward insight **only** after **three backward reflective passes**.
Forward output is limited to **scheduling, preparation, and small reversible next steps**—not prediction.

## Operator
`+= Backwards 3`

- `+=` learning accumulates (no erasure)
- `Backwards` begin from the present outcome/state
- `3` three passes: Outcome → Inversion → Constraint truth

## The Three Backward Passes
### Backward 1 — Outcome Scan (Temporal Snapshot)
**Prompt:** “What phase am I clearly in right now?”
- Describe the current state without story or explanation:
  - energy, capacity, stress load, clarity, constraints

**Literary symbol:** *The final page read first.*

### Backward 2 — Inversion Pass (Flip Meaning)
**Prompt:** “What assumptions should be flipped?”
- “Bad timing” → unready system
- “Good timing” → low resistance moment
- “Missed chance” → phase protection / misalignment signal

**Literary symbol:** *The unreliable narrator.*

### Backward 3 — Constraint Audit (What time would not allow)
**Prompt:** “What actions are impossible in this phase without harm, force, or fantasy energy?”
- If it can’t happen safely/reliably here, it’s not aligned.

**Literary symbol:** *The editor’s red pen.*

## Forward Release (Allowed Outputs)
Only after Backward 3:
- choose a smallest safe action
- schedule it to a better-aligned window (Day Shift preferred)
- capture notes; avoid conclusions at night

**Literary symbol:** *The farmer, not the prophet.*

## Safety Boundary (Hard Rules)
- No claims of literal prediction, fate, or causality manipulation
- No escalation into urgency, paranoia, or “time reversal”
- If stress rises: **HARD STOP — ANCHOR TO ZERO**

## Compatibility
Designed to interoperate with:
- Cipher 7 (Inverse-Constraint Questioning)
- Cipher 9.1 (Curved reflection + residue)
- Day/Night Shift rules (Night = capture-only)
