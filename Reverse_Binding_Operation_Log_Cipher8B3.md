# Reverse Binding Operation Log — Cipher 8.B3
**Goal:** Apply `+= Backwards 3` to Cipher 8 and bind as a new cipher variant, using reverse order (Version reiteration → Codex addition → Cipher lock).

## Reverse Step 3 — Version Reiteration (performed first)
Declared end-state (pre-lock view):
- Hodges Codex: next version pending Nick assignment
- Cipher Library: next version pending Nick assignment
- New cipher: Cipher 8.B3 — Backward-Validated Temporal Alignment

Purpose: prevent mixing systems; treat versioning as a constraint anchor.

## Reverse Step 2 — Codex Addition (performed second)
Staged insertion into:
- Cipher 8 — Temporal Alignment section
- New sub-entry: 8.B3
Guardrails attached:
- retrospective validation
- reflection-gated forward release
- Night Shift safe behavior

Rule added:
Cipher 8 may not speak forward unless it has already spoken backward three times.

## Reverse Step 1 — Cipher Lock (performed last)
Cipher definition sealed (pending version number):
- No literal prediction or causality manipulation
- Forward output restricted to scheduling/prep/small reversible steps
- Hard Stop: “HARD STOP — ANCHOR TO ZERO”

## Behavioral Learning Integrated (Small → Big → Big → Small)
- Start with limits (small) to prevent inflation
- Scale ideas within structure (big)
- Preserve reusability by ending minimal (small)

## Version Fields (Nick to assign)
- Hodges Codex version: ______ → ______
- Cipher Library version: ______ → ______
- Cipher 8.B3 version: ______
